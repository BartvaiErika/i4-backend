//    Develop a program that reads the participants.csv file and displays every participant’s name together with the vortex mathematical value of that name. In order to do at least accomplish something smaller, make sure you have one class that receives a name and returns its vortex number.
//    Create a unit test for the algorithm to ensure it’s working correctly.
//            Hints:
//    Consider that every letter has the ascii value as a number. Then just add all those values together following the Vortex based mathematics formula to figure out the final vortex number.
//    Remember that to convert one char into an int you just cast it: int number = (char) character;
